# SLP-Framework-MissingLandmarksPose
SLP-MissingLandmarkPoseFramework is a framework for improving pose estimation in sign language processing. We evaluate the impact of missing landmarks on isolated sign language recognition. This framework is designed to assist researchers in improving pose estimation by deciding to ignore or not the frames with missing values with low impact.
